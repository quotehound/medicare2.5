## Known Bugs <a name = "bugs"></a>

  - API post bug: 
    - when making an api GET call or i think any just AXIOS call, react scripts no longer has modules to cover for polyphil which in turn makes missing modules or does not have any polyphils that are needed. I have tried installing libraries, dependencies, and even creating a webpack config file with no solution yet.
